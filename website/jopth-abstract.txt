Rapid advances in information technology have dramatically transformed the world during the past several decades. Access to
computers and the World Wide Web is increasingly required for education and employment, as well as for many activities of
daily living. While these changes have improved society in many respects, they present an obstacle for visually disabled
patients who may have significant difficulty processing the visual cues presented by modern graphical user interfaces. This
paper reviews the specific barriers to computer and Web access faced by visually disabled patients, describes clinical
evaluation methods, summarizes traditional low vision methods as well as newer assistive computer technologies for universal
accessibility, and discusses emerging technologies and future directions in this area.
