<P><U>Use case</U>: Some members of a group of researchers are disabled. The 
group is collaborating on a project and is using a threading-enabled web-based 
message board for communication. However, since some of the researchers are 
disabled, they use screen readers, text magnifiers or voice-to-text engines in 
order to participate. These varied resources may be inconvenient and may hinder 
the user from participating conveniently and fully. With screen readers, the 
user would have to listen to large amounts of extra information on the webboard 
before gaining access to the information he/she is seeking. Similarly, text 
magnifiers increase not only the size of the text that the user wants, but also 
the text that he/she isn?t interested in or has already read. Lastly, in case of 
annotations and replies to previously posted messages, the user may have to 
start scanning from the beginning of the message board to read the latest 
additions, which would be excessively time consuming. 
<P><U>Our Research</U>: Collaboration with disabled members of the group may be 
difficult since the formats in which data can be displayed are inappropriate. 
For example, both the message board itself as well as the web pages they link to 
may contain clutter, such as pop-up ads, unnecessary images and extraneous links 
around the body of an article that distract a user from actual content. 
Additionally, messages, annotations and replies to team members? messages are 
rarely posted in real time and usually require team members to go back to the 
message to look for replies. Participants using tools designed for the disabled 
would have to tediously scan through the entire message board for messages with 
additions. In order to solve this problem, one may trivially design different 
versions of the same message board, each specifically suited for the user. But 
we believe that for good collaborative work to take place, it is imperative to 
create a system that can be used simply by all members of a team in a WYSIWIS 
(what you see is what I see) format. It should not only support all the advanced 
features of the message board, but also make the space simple and easily 
?accessible? for all users. 
<P>Content Extraction of the ?useful and relevant? parts from web pages has many 
applications, including cell phone and PDA browsing, speech rendering for the 
visually impaired, and text summarization. Most approaches to removing clutter 
or making content more readable involve changing font size or removing HTML and 
data components such as images, which takes away from a webpage?s inherent look 
and feel. Unlike ?Content Reformatting?, which aims to reproduce the entire 
webpage in a more convenient form, our solution directly addresses Content 
Extraction. We have developed a framework that employs an easily extensible set 
of techniques that incorporate advantages of previous work on content 
extraction. Our key insight is to work with the Document Object Model tree, 
rather than with raw HTML markup. We have implemented our approach in a publicly 
available Web proxy to extract content from HTML web pages. 
<P>In order to analyze a web page for content extraction, the page is first 
passed through an HTML parser that corrects the HTML and creates a Document 
Object Model tree representation of the web page. Once processed, the resulting 
DOM document can be seamlessly shown as a webpage to the end-user as if it were 
HTML. The DOM tree is hierarchically arranged and can be analyzed in sections or 
as a whole, providing a wide range of flexibility for our extraction algorithm. 
Our content extractor then navigates the DOM tree recursively, using a series of 
different filtering techniques to remove and modify specific nodes and leave 
only the content behind. There are two sets of filters, with different levels of 
granularity. The first set of filters simply disregards tags or specific 
attributes within tags. These filters allow images, links, scripts, styles, and 
other such elements to be quickly removed from the web page. The second set of 
filters is more complex and algorithmic, consisting of the advertisement 
remover, the link list remover, the empty table remover, and the removed link 
retainer. 
<P>CRUNCH is implemented as a proxy that filters webpages before they are loaded 
into the users? browsers. It simply treats webpages as an accordion, removing 
less or more extraneous content from a webpage based on the user?s settings. The 
server version is multi-threaded and can support multiple clients with different 
settings. Therefore a participant has the option of looking at the message board 
without any reductions in the ?clutter? on the screen, while a disabled 
participant can tune his/her proxy to look only at the content of the page. The 
proxy is also fitted with an event monitoring system that keeps track of changes 
to the website. Therefore, disabled as well as non-disabled users can either be 
notified only of the changes (along with the context of the change and the 
related messages to the responses and annotations). If a participant joins the 
message board late, then the event notification system can call on Natural 
Language Processing summarization algorithms to give a quick summary of all the 
changes that have taken place to bring the user up to speed. The results will 
still be piped through the proxy in order to display the changes efficiently.
